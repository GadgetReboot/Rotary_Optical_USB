Place code.py in the root folder of the pi pico and make sure the required library files are in a "lib" folder from the root as well.<br>
The library files are copied from the Adafruit library bundle by clicking the link to the "latest release" here https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle
<br>Then after downloading the zip of the library bundle version that matches the Circuit Python version on the Pi Pico (eg. major version 8 is the current stable release), copy the lib files to the Pico (there may be too many files to fit on the Pico if the whole lib folder is copied).
