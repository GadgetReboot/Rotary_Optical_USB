The code.py files are located in version folders where the highest version is the current one and the others are for backups.<br>
Choose the latest code.py file and see how it works.<br><br>
Place code.py in the root folder of the pi pico and make sure the required library files are in a "lib" folder from the root as well.<br><br>
The library files are copied from the Adafruit library bundle by clicking the link to the "latest release" located in the description section of this github page:  https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle <br>
<br>Then after downloading the zip of the library bundle version that matches the Circuit Python version on the Pi Pico (eg. major version 8 is the current stable release), unzip and copy the lib files to the Pico (there may be too many files to fit on the Pico if the whole lib folder is copied).
<br><br> The libraries needed are the debouncer, ticks, and the whole adafruit_hid sub folder.
